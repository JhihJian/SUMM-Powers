description: Execute small, straightforward tasks quickly without design overhead
---

Use summ:todo to handle simple tasks: analyze → confirm → execute → verify.

**Use for:**
- Simple fixes (typos, renames, small logic changes)
- Small features (add loading state, simple validation)
- Setup tasks (install dependencies, configure tools)
- Clear bug fixes with known solutions

**NOT for:**
- New features requiring architecture decisions
- Multi-system changes affecting many files
- Tasks where the approach is unclear
